# Object-Detection
Android Mobile Application for Object Detection

This is an Android application that uses OpenCV to search images for specific objects in different scenes.
For demonstration purposes, there are 3 images the user will perform analysis on in order to recognize 3 different objects.
Additionally, the user is able to detect multiple objects simultaneously, considering the objects were prerecorded.
